  description: "Fence Agents Remediation Operator (FAR)\n\nThe operator will remediate/fence
    a node when a FenceAgentsRemediation (far) custom resource exists with the node's
    name.\nFAR uses an existing set of upstream fencing agents for environments with
    a \ntraditional API end-point (e.g., IPMI) for power cycling cluster nodes.\n\nThe
    operator is recommended to be used with Node Healthcheck Operator for easier and
    smoother experience,\nbut it can also work as a standalonde remediator for the
    more advanced user.\n"
