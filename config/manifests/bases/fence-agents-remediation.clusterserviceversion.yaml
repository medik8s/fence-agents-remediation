    ### Introduction
    Fence Agents Remediation (FAR) is a Kubernetes operator that uses well-known agents to fence and remediate unhealthy nodes.
    The remediation includes rebooting the unhealthy node using a fence agent and then evicting workloads from the unhealthy node.

    ### Compatibility
    FAR is one of the remediator operators by [Medik8s](https://www.medik8s.io/remediation/remediation/),
    such as [Self Node Remediation](https://github.com/medik8s/self-node-remediation) and [Machine Deletion Remediation](https://github.com/medik8s/machine-deletion-remediation),
    that were designed to run with the Node HealthCheck Operator [(NHC)](https://github.com/medik8s/node-healthcheck-operator) which detects an unhealthy node and creates remediation CR.
    It is recommended to use FAR with NHC for an easier and smoother experience by fully automating the remediation process, but it can be used as a standalone remediator for the more experienced user.

    ### Advantages
    - Robustness - FAR has direct feedback from the traditional Application Programming Interface (API) call (e.g., IPMI) about the result of the fence action without using the Kubernetes API.
    - Speed - FAR is rapid since it can reboot a node and receive an acknowledgment from the API call while other remediators might need to wait a safe time till they can expect the node to be rebooted.
    - Diversity - FAR includes several fence agents from a large known set of upstream fencing agents for bare metal servers, virtual machines, cloud platforms, etc.
    - Adjustability - FAR allows to set up different parameters for running the API call that remediates the node.
